Takeoff
=======

To use Takeoff just make sure to rename the top level directory and to replace
everything that is marked with a ``FIXME`` comment.

It encourages you to have:

- docs (with Sphinx_)
- tests (with pytest_)
- a LICENSE file (use `Choose a license`_)

To learn what to do with ``dev-requirements.in`` file look into the `pip-tools`_.
